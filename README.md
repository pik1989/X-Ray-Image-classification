**Problem Statement:** The goal of this project is to classify Chest X-ray images as normal(healthy) or Pneumonia cases using CNN, Pre-Trained Models & Vision Transformers and compare the results.

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.

Vision Transformer (ViT) emerged as a competitive alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are currently state-of-the-art in computer vision and widely used for different image recognition tasks.

**Model Outputs:**

| Model               |      Parameters Trained      |  Accuracy |
|---------------------|:----------------------------:|----------:|
|      CNN 2D         |          left-aligned        |    72     |
| Pre-Trained - VGG16 |            centered          |    91.4   |
| Vision Transformer  |         right-aligned        |    72     |
